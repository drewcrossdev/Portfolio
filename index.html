			<h1>Hi I'm Drew Cross</h1>
			<h3>Full Stack Developer</h3>
			<p>
				I am a graduate from Durham College for the Computer Programming and
				Analysis Program. I have additional post-secondary experience at
				Conestoga where I attended the Computer Engineering Technology program.
				I enjoyed my time at Conestoga, but I found myself only motivated in our
				programming classes (C/C++). Before attending Durham, I took some time
				to consider my next step. Once at Durham, I learned various languages,
				including HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Python, etc. Through my learning I
				realized that programming is my passion. I especially enjoy designing
				user experiences for software, especially websites.
			</p>

			<p>
				As of now, I am highly interested in working in web development as a
				Full Stack Developer, specifically using the MERN stack. I have been
				teaching myself the MERN stack for a while now, and made my first
				application with it in my final semester with a partner. The project
				which uses the MERN stack and other technologies such as AWS and Postman
				is linked in the Projects section. I am an extremely motivated and
				passionate individual that loves to have a positive effect on those
				around me. I have strong social and communication skills thanks to my
				extensive history working in customer service and as a result I thrive
				working in team environments. I also believe heavily in strong practice
				to reinforce one's skills and that making mistakes helps you improve.
				After all, I made a mistake with my first program choice, which led me
				to where I am today.

									This project I completed with a fellow student. A capstone
									project was worth essentially our entire grade for the class.
									We had 4 months to develop a project we wanted and my partner
									and I decided to do a video sharing site using the MERN stack
									as we are both aspiring MERN stack developers. I was
									responsible for most of the front-end in this project while my
									partner handled the back-end. Our project was presented at the
									2023 Durham College IT Expo.
